## 📚 Current Submissions

### ✅ ASSIGNMENTx1: College Routine Planner
📅 **Date**: 20-05-2025  
👨‍💻 **Author**: Somapuram Uday  
📌 **Objective**:  
Implement a time-based daily routine planner using Python's if-elif-else ladder. Based on wake-up time input, the assistant suggests appropriate actions like continuing sleep, preparing for college, or joining internship sessions.

🔧 **Key Features**:
- Time parsing from float format
- Conversion to total minutes since midnight
- Structured decision ladder with context-aware messages

### ✅ PROJECT_QUALIFICATION_TASKx1: DataFrame Manipulations
📅 **Date**: 07-06-2025  
📌 **Objective**:  
Practice low-level pandas DataFrame manipulations without using built-in shortcuts like `.apply()`, `.dt`, etc. Focuses on logic-building and manual operations.

🔧 **Tasks Covered**:
1. Logarithmic transformations using loops
2. Conditional replacement based on sign of values
3. Classification of even integers
4. Index column generation without default methods

### ✅ FINAL PROJECT: EDA × Mobile Device Usage Analysis
📅 **Date**: 15-06-2025  
📌 **Objective**:  
Perform an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on mobile device usage dataset. Identify user behavior, brand/OS trends, and draw statistical insights.

🔧 **Highlights**:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Visualizations with seaborn and matplotlib
- User segmentation by behavior class
- OS and brand usage patterns
- App usage, battery, and screen time analysis

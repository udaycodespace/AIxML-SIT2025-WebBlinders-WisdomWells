## 📚 Current Submissions

### ✅ ASSIGNMENTx1: College Routine Planner
📅 **Date**: 20-05-2025  
👨‍💻 **Author**: Somapuram Uday  
📌 **Objective**:  
Implement a time-based daily routine planner using Python's if-elif-else ladder. Based on wake-up time input, the assistant suggests appropriate actions like continuing sleep, preparing for college, or joining internship sessions.

🔧 **Key Features**:
- Time parsing from float format
- Conversion to total minutes since midnight
- Structured decision ladder with context-aware messages

### ✅ ASSIGNMENTx2: Data Extraction from Mixed List
📅 **Date**: 21-05-2025  
📌 **Objective**:  
Extract and analyze different data types from a mixed Python list consisting of tuples, lists, and dictionaries.

🔧 **Key Concepts**:
- Type checking using `isinstance()`
- List comprehension and iteration
- Flattening nested structures
- Summation and odd-value filtering

### ✅ PROJECT_QUALIFICATION_TASKx1: DataFrame Manipulations
📅 **Date**: 07-06-2025  
📌 **Objective**:  
Practice low-level pandas DataFrame manipulations without using built-in shortcuts like `.apply()`, `.dt`, etc. Focuses on logic-building and manual operations.

🔧 **Tasks Covered**:
1. Logarithmic transformations using loops
2. Conditional replacement based on sign of values
3. Classification of even integers
4. Index column generation without default methods

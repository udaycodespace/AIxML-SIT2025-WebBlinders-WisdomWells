        "\n",
        "This assignment is to implement a **time-based routine assistant** using Python's `if-elif-else` ladder. Based on the user's **wake-up time**, the program suggests suitable actions — from continuing sleep, getting ready for college, or preparing for internships.\n",

        "\n",
        "## 🚀 How it works\n",
        "\n",
        "- The program asks the user to **input wake-up time in `H.MM` format**, e.g., `6.30`, `7.00`, etc.\n",
        "- It **converts the time to total minutes** since midnight for easier comparisons.\n",
        "- Using a structured `if-elif-else` ladder, it checks the time range and **prints a suitable message** (e.g., \"Get ready for college\", \"You woke up too early\", etc.).\n",
